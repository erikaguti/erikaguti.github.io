							<p class="major"> My name is Erika. 
								My first job out of college was a data analyst at RE Tech Advisors in Falls Church, Virginia, helping industry leading REITS visually understand the energy and water consumption of the buildings in their portfolio. Plus many other data monkey tasks. 
								During this time I gained a strong curiosity in the field of data and computer science. After self-teaching myself programming fundamentals, Python, and SQL, I decided to move to Barcelona, Spain and attend the Barcelona School of Economics, a top 10 economics research university. 
								I was able to train among some of the most brilliant minds currently at the intersection of the fields of economics and machine learning. I am now working with one them, Hannes Mueller, at the Fundación de Economía Analítica. </p>
