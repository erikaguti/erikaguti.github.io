						<p>Along with working as a data analyst, I am also on my company’s social media team. 
							During a content brainstorm session, I brought up the 
							idea of making some fun data visualizations that show fun facts about the employees 
							at our company. The team liked this idea and in the end I made a pictograph waffle chart, choropleth map, connection map, and bubble map using R and Python. 
							It was my first time using these languages to make data visualizations and it was a lot of fun as well as a great learning experience. </p>
